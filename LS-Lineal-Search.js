/**
 * Lineal Search
 * this is the most used search, starting from the first 
 * element for example in an array from 0 to n -1
 * but the bad side of this search is the time that it can need.
 * for example if we have an array of 10 elements and the last position is the el
 * that weÂ´re looking for, we need 10 attempts to find it. 
 * 
 * the biggest number of attempts that we can have with this search to find our element is n!
